        Hi my name is Benoit, I have a passion for design, in fact I wanted to become a webdesigner... But I fell in love with my actual job : front end developer <br/>
        I'm used to work with Angular, and love making animations, and integrate beautiful interfaces to improve the user experience. <br/>
        I'm currently working for Capgemini where I work for L'or√©al.
